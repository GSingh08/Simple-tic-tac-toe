# Simple-tic-tac-toe

### What Did I Create?

I Created a very simple two player Tic Tac Toe game.

Some of the elements of the page are as follows :

* The Game board that the user inputs their 'X' or 'O'.
* A message that pops up once the game has been completed.
* A reset button for when the user wants to reset the game.

### Some of the Tools I used 

To create this game, I used HTML CSS and Javascript.  While using Javascript I worked with :
- `strings`
- `numbers`
- `arrays`
- `objects`
- `functions`
- `booleans`
- `control flow structures`
- `DOM`

## What Did I Learn?

* HTML , CSS, Javascript
* Manipulating the DOM
* Styling and Adding HTML elements using Javascript
